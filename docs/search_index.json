[["index.html", "Covid Impact Chapter 1 Introduction", " Covid Impact Run Zhang, Miranda Zhou, Mohan Duan, Neha Pusarla 2020-12-14 Chapter 1 Introduction Around March of 2020, a global pandemic affected the lives of millions all over the world. This disease caused restaurants to shut down, encouraged travel bans, empty the streets of the cities, increased hospitalization, and many other factors. Everyone’s lives changed without a warning, and there was no vaccine to change the situation that was the coronavirus. While the whole world went into lockdown, many people’s mental health was affected as well as their physical health. The stock market fluctuated, and many were laid off or put out of a job, leaving them to struggle to find food and shelter at a time where these fundamentals were so crucial. Overall, the whole world was heavily impacted. Our main goal in studying this topic is to examine its impact on different industries due to the pandemic. We are asking four main questions, the first being how did the pandemic impact travel and the airline industry? How did the restaurant industry change? Do health mandates help curb the spread of Covid-19? For example, wearing masks and social distancing? What was the impact on hospital hours and the number of beds available? All of these questions are important in determining the role that the coronavirus played in the country’s life, and we want to provide insights that can visualize the impact for everyone. People can understand the effect more clearly, and use this information to determine how careful they want to be during this time period.

Describe the data sources: who is responsible for collecting the data? How is it collected? If there were a choice of options, explain how you chose. Provide some basic information about the dataset: types of variables, number of records, etc. Describe any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. (suggested: approximately 1 page) 2.2 Country Policy Orders Data Source: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-state-and-county-policy-orders 2.2.1 Description This is a federal government website managed by the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. This data is a manually curated dataset that provides a standardized view into state and county policy orders (executive orders, ordinances, etc.) from the following sources: BU COVID-19 State Policy Database - Raifman J, Nocka K, Jones D, Bor J, Lipson S, Jay J, and Chan P. (2020). “COVID-19 US state policy database.” wikidata - Stay At Home Policies Queried from WikiData. Manual curation by a dedicated group of Virtual Student Federal Service Interns - Summer 2020: T Adler, J Bastian, L Beckett, M Cohen, K Honey, C Kennedy, E Nudell. We chose this dataset over the BU google form linked in the sources because this dataset is much more consolidated. In addition, the website seems more reputable because it is from the government. 2.2.2 Basic Information about Dataset: The dataset has categories: State, county, zip code, policy level, date, start stop, comments, source, total phases. There are 3507 instances. The details are as below taken from their dictionary (https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-state-and-county-policy-orders-data-dictionary): state_id (string): The two digit state code for the policy change county (optional string): The county name where the policy change was implemented. Optional due to counties occasionally implementing their own policies. fips_code (string): A list of fips codes where the policy change is occurring. This is the authoritative column for where a county policy change occurs. policy_level (string): Whether the policy is a state of county-level policy. Either “state” or “county.” date (date, formatted YYYY-MM-dd): The date of the policy. Please note that there is also a start and stop column, to indicate whether this date is for the beginning or end of the policy. policy_type (string): The “type” of policy this in. Generically fitted in to many categories including Gym policies, Food and Drink policies, Stay at Home policies, and more. start_stop (string): Either “start” or “stop” Indicating whether this entry is for the beginning or end of a policy, respectively. comments (string): Details about the policies. In some cases, simply a link to a website with more information. source (string): Where this policy comes from. Either BU COVID-19 Policy Database, Wikidata, manual (no source), or sip_submission_form (with source website URL). total_phases (integer): As some states shifted to reopening policies, this column captures the number of phases of reopening that were expected. Issues about data: This dataset pulls from many different sources. Hence, there are some missing values because some instances only have information about states in general rather than counties. 2.3 Hospitalization Data Data Source: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-estimated-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state 2.3.1 Description This is a federal government website managed by the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. The following dataset provides state-aggregated data for hospital utilization. These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities. The file will be updated daily and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting. We chose this dataset because it is from a very official source and is consolidated rather than its sources. 2.3.2 Basic Information on this dataset: They are all numerical values. Some percentages and some numbers. There are 60 different columns and 54 instances. Details of all the columns are listed in this dictionary (https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state-data-dictionary) Some examples are listed below: state: The two digit state code critical_staffing_shortage_today_yes: Number of hospitals reporting a critical staffing shortage today in this state. hospital_onset_covid: Total current inpatients with onset of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 fourteen or more days after admission for a condition other than COVID-19 in this state. previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed: Number of patients who were admitted to an adult inpatient bed on the previous calendar day who had confirmed COVID-19 at the time of admission in this state staffed_adult_icu_bed_occupancy: Reported total number of staffed inpatient adult ICU beds that are occupied in this state total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_and_suspected_covid_coverage: Number of hospitals reporting total_staffed_adult_icu_beds: Reported total number of staffed inpatient adult ICU beds in this state inpatient_beds_utilization: Percentage of inpatient beds that are being utilized in this state. This number only accounts for hospitals in the state that report both “inpatient_beds_used” and “inpatient_beds” fields. inpatient_bed_covid_utilization_coverage: Number of hospitals reporting both “inpatient_beds_used_covid” and “inpatient_beds”. adult_icu_bed_covid_utilization: Percentage of total staffed adult ICU beds currently utilized by patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in this state. This number only accounts for hospitals in the state that report both “staffed_icu_adult_patients_confirmed_and_suspected_covid” and “total_staffed_adult_icu_beds” fields. reporting_cutoff_start: Look back date start - The latest reports from each hospital is summed for this report starting with this date. Issues with data: According to the data source no statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data. Otherwise, we do not see major issues. 2.4 Restaurant data Data source: https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry 2.4.1 Description The data indexes two things. First, the overall impact of Covid 19 on the industry by showing year-over-year seated diners at a sample of restaurants on the OpenTable network across all channels: online reservations, phone reservations, and walk-ins. For year-over-year comparisons by day, we compare to the same day of the week from the same week in the previous year. For example, we’d compare Tuesday of week 11 in 2020 to Tuesday of week 11 in 2019. Only states or metros with 50+ restaurants on the OpenTable network for 2019 or 2020 are included in the sample. To better reflect the state of the industry overall, this dataset is based on a sample of approximately 20,000 restaurants that provide OpenTable with information on all of their inventory. This sample of restaurants typically accounts for a majority of our seated online reservations. Second, a comparison of year-over-year seated covers to demonstrate where we are seeing recovery start to take shape. This table shows year-over-year seated covers across all channels at only the restaurants that have chosen to reopen in a given market. As an example, if there were 50 seated covers in restaurants that have recently reopened in a given locale on May 11, 2019 and on the same day in 2020 there was 1, then 2% will be displayed. For this chart, only markets with 500+ restaurants on OpenTable of which 10%+ are accepting online reservations are included. 2.5 Airlines Data Data source: https://www.bts.gov/data-spotlight/airlines-july-operations 2.5.1 Description This airlines data is from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The BTS is part of the Department of Transportation and is the main source of data on many different transportation factors such as commercial aviation, transportation economics, and freight activity. The data provided on this website is collected from the Bureau’s National Transportation Library, which contains many different publications and information about the transportation community. We chose this dataset because it provides valuable information on how the airline community was affected by the oncoming of the now widespread pandemic, Covid-19. 2.5.2 Basic Information about Dataset: year(int) - year of flight month(string) - month of flight Total Domestic Flights Operated(int) - total number of flights operated that month/year airline(string) - airline brand Issues about dataset: Since there is limited information in this dataset, we will have to manipulate some variables using the information we have to analyze the data further and make stronger conclusions. Additional variables will include numerical variables such as the percent change in number of flights from each month in 2019 and 2020. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Country Policy Orders 3.2 Hospitalization Data 3.3 Airlines Covid Data 3.4 Restaurant data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Describe the process of getting the data into a form in which you could work with it in R. If your code does not lend itself to being including in the .Rmd file, provide a link to the folder or file(s) that contain(s) that code. Write a draft of the Data Transformation chapter 3.1 Country Policy Orders This dataset comes in a csv format, which can be read in using “read.csv()”. As described earlier, each row in this dataset is either a start or end of a policy. There is also information on both county and states. For our analysis, we will look at county and states separately. In addition, when we aggregate the number of states that enacted certain policies, we will only look at values where “start_stop” is “start” so we do not count double.

To do this, we extract total bed “inpatient bed”, covid bed “inpatient_beds_used_covid”, non-covid bed “inpatient_beds_used - covid_bed”, and empty bed “total bed - inpatient_beds_used”. We also analyze staffing shortages in a similar fashion. Staff information is columns 1-7. ## state critical_staffing_shortage_today_yes critical_staffing_shortage_today_no ## 1 PR 7 15 ## 2 RI 2 11 ## 3 SC 22 48 ## 4 SD 10 49 ## 5 TN 24 80 ## 6 TX 132 451 ## critical_staffing_shortage_today_not_reported ## 1 47 ## 2 1 ## 3 2 ## 4 3 ## 5 40 ## 6 0 ## critical_staffing_shortage_anticipated_within_week_yes ## 1 8 ## 2 2 ## 3 27 ## 4 13 ## 5 35 ## 6 156 ## critical_staffing_shortage_anticipated_within_week_no ## 1 14 ## 2 11 ## 3 43 ## 4 46 ## 5 69 ## 6 427 ## critical_staffing_shortage_anticipated_within_week_not_reported ## 1 47 ## 2 1 ## 3 2 ## 4 3 ## 5 40 ## 6 0 We then calculate the proportion by diving those that reported “critical staffing shortage today yes” over the sum of both yes and no. 3.3 Airlines Covid Data This dataset comes in a xlsx format, therefore we installed the “readxl” package, and read in the data using the commands from that package. Since there are some extra spaces in the excel sheet, we remade the table into a form that had no blank spaces, and thus easily callable by column name, which is a dataframe in R. Combining all the columns together into a dataframe, we then renamed the columns such that it would be representative of the information in the column. Lastly, since all the data was in character format, we converted all the columns that had numeric data to a numeric form, such that it can be easily used to create graphs and other visual structures to aid us in our exploratory analysis. Our final product of the downloaded data was a dataframe in R, which had columns that were clearly represented by their names, no missing slots or data, and all the data was the right type of class to work with. The top 5 rows of how the dataframe is structured can be seen below. This will be used for different types of analyses on the impact of covid on the airline/travel industry. ## year month Tot_Flights Alaska Allegiant American Delta Frontier Hawaiian JetBlue ## 1 2019 January 619099 34663 6713 162931 134243 9496 7514 23463 ## 2 2019 February 564614 30069 7180 150607 121264 8643 6668 22053 ## 3 2019 March 675659 35864 10218 173395 151495 9663 7581 25502 ## 4 2019 April 652533 35270 9219 165821 146206 9637 7611 24966 ## 5 2019 May 680165 37218 9008 177012 151695 11254 7958 24886 ## 6 2019 June 679802 37953 11037 173440 153427 11337 7896 24204 ## Southwest Spirit United ## 1 107363 15023 117690 ## 2 94922 13447 109761 ## 3 114119 17034 130788 ## 4 110752 16316 126735 ## 5 113709 17814 129611 ## 6 112879 17553 130076 3.4 Restaurant data This dataset comes in a csv format, which can be read in using R commands. This data contains information for other countries, we need to select US cities. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Country Policy Orders 4.2 Hospitalization 4.3 Airlines Covid Data 4.4 Restaurant data", " Chapter 4 Missing values Describe any patterns you discover in missing values. 4.1 Country Policy Orders ## total_phases fips_code state_id county policy_level date policy_type ## 2858 1659 0 0 0 0 0 ## start_stop comments source ## 0 0 0 There are a few missing values county, zip_code (fips_cod), and total phases. The missing county and zip code values are because if the policy is state wide, there is no entry in zip code or county. Hence there is no zip code and country details. In addition, most instances do not have total phases so there are many missing values there. Based on these observations, we will look at policy order dataset in both the county and state point of view. 4.2 Hospitalization There are some 0 values that may be missing values in our dataset. 4.3 Airlines Covid Data There are no values missing in our dataset. The only “missing values” we had were those in the year column. The way the data was initially presented in the table, one year was written in the year column on the first row for the whole year, meaning for the next 12 rows, representing a month per row. In order to make our data more understandable and usable, such that we would not have to hard code any data, we added values to the year column, instead of leaving it blank, such that we would have a full dataset to work with. For example, instead of having only 2019 in the first row under the year column, we added 2019 to the rest of the rows until December in the year column, such that we would have a full dataset, making it easier to classify and facet data if necessary. As seen from this missing data dataframe, there is no dark squares representing no missing data for this dataset. 4.4 Restaurant data There are many missing values in the dataset before May 2020. We also need to extract data for US. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Covid Cases 5.2 County 5.3 Hospital 5.4 Covid Impact on Airlines 5.5 Covid Impact on Restaurants", " Chapter 5 Results This is results. 5.1 Covid Cases 5.1.1 Covid Maps This graph shows that the darkest states have the highest number of coronavirus cases. From this graph we can see that California, Texas, and Florida have the greatest number of cases, while the majority of central America seem to have few cases in comparison. In addition, hovering over each state will give more information on how many exact total cases are in each state. In contrast to the first map, the second map now shows the number of positive covid cases per capita. This map can give more clear information on how each state is handling the pandemic as it takes population of each state into account. In the first map, it appeared as if California, Texas, and Florida were doing the worst with the pandemic. With this new map we can see that North Dakota is actually the state that is affected the most, as it has the most covid cases per capita, and that California and Texas pale in comparison to other states in Central America. This parallel coordinates plot is another representation of how each state is being affected by the coronavirus pandemic. From this graph, we can observe that high number of cases in the state does not directly coordinate to high cases per capita, and that most of the states with low covid case numbers actually have more cases per capita. 5.1.2 Covid19 Cases in Time Series This graph shows the cummulative number of covid cases starting from February of 2020 to December of 2020. As shown, it looks like the first case of the coronavirus was reported in the United States in February, and has had an exponential trend in the number of cases since then. Specifically from September to December, cases almost doubled from the first eight months. This graph plots time series data of the covid cases from the first case in the US in February of 2020 to December of 2020. While there have been minor dips in the daily number of cases such as in June and September, there is mostly an upwards trend, specifically a spike from November to December. 5.2 County We see that over 400 counties have enacted Shelter in Place policies. Other regulations such as food and drink, mask requirement are also very common. There are only 23 different policies across all the counties. On the other hand, there were 59 different policies across the 50 states with may only enacted by 1 state. This is also due to inconsistency in the naming of these policies across states. Some policies, however, have almost states enacting it. For example, regulations on entertainment, food and drink, and non-essential businesses. 5.3 Hospital All hospital data is from November 26, 2020. We want to analyze the bed usage in hospitals through visualizations below. Through this chart, we see that the majority of beds occupied for all states are not covid related. States such as North and South Dakota have over 20% of their bed usage on covid-19 patients. As of November 26, there are more empty beds than beds occupied by covid patients. However, that difference is not very large in many states that may have less beds overall. To build on this intuition, we will explore the hospital’s own expressions about having a critical staffing shortage. This histogram demonstrates the percentage of hospitals within a State that reported critical staffing shortages in regards to open bed space. We see that many states have more than 20% of their hospitals reporting critical staffing shortage as of November 26. This provides further insight in our previous chart because even though there seemingly are many empty beds left, hospitals themselves have reported critical shortages. 5.4 Covid Impact on Airlines Something to point out in this airline dataset is that only the data for the first 7 months of 2020 is given, from January to July, and thus, the graphs including 2019 data will only include the data from the first seven months to make proper observations. Therefore, using only the first 7 months of the 2019 data to compare its results more accuractely with the first 7 months of the 2020 data, we see a clear distinctment between the number of flights taken in 2019 vs. 2020, observing that the pandemic could have played a role in this distinctment. Let us see use covid case data to detect the pattern of how the number of coronavirus cases in the United States affected the number of flights taken in and out of the US. This graph shows when the coronavirus hit the United States hard, and affected many different factors, one being the airline industry. Although there were cases in January, the number of cases quickly ramped up from March to April, which correlates with the decline in travel. From the graph, it can be seen that around May, although cases were still increasing, travel started to increase again, as people started to most likely relax on restrictions. This data shows by how much percent the number of flights in each airline decreased from the first couple months, pre-covid, to the rest of the year, after the oncoming of the pandemic in the United States. As shown by the graph, every single airline was affected by the pandemic as they all have a positive percent change, meaning that there was a decline in the number of flights for each airline. The airlines that were affected the most were JetBlue, Hawaiian, and United. These airlines had at least a 60% decline in flights when the pandemic started. This graph shows the pattern of the top four airline brands affected, taken from the previous graph. The trends stay consistent with the trends that we’ve been seeing in the previous graphs. 5.4.0.1 Final Findings on Airline Data The most revealing findings from this exploratory data analysis showed a couple of things. Firstly, there was a major decrease in flights from the year 2019 to the year 2020. Secondly, the number of flights mainly dropped in April of 2020, correlating with the time that the lockdown started and travel restrictions were placed everywhere. Looking at each airline, there was a decrease of the total number of flights taken for each airline, showing that almost every airline industry was affected by the pandemic. Some airlines had a decrease in flights by more than 60%, showing the intensity of the effect on the airline industry. More than half of their revenue was gone. Overall, in terms of the effect on travel during the coronavirus pandemic, there are clear patterns that show that travel was greatly affected. Airplanes were not a first choice method of transporation anymore, as people were not even travelling in the first place. This major decline in airline transportation and travel in and out of the United States, shows how greatly the pandemic played a role in the decline of the airline industry. 5.5 Covid Impact on Restaurants "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Travel in 2019 Travel in 2020 Total Flights in a Given Year Click on a button to see the pattern of the total number of flights taken in a given year. What pattern do you notice between the years of 2019 and 2020? From this graph, we can clearly see a big drop in flights from March to April of 2020. One can assume from this drop that the pandemic most likely played a role in the decrease of flights. Around May, the number of flights slowly start to increase, but not to the level that it was at the beginning of the year, as can be seen by the comparison to the flights taken in May of 2019. Even though flight frequency increased, it is still not even half as close to the regular frequency of flights. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion One of the limitations for the airline data was that it did not have data in 2020 for the months of August to November, and therefore, we could not make further analyses about the impact of the pandemic past July. From all the graphs, there was one common theme that the pandemic definitely had the biggest impact on the airline industry from March to April. In the future, we would like to explore how the airline industry changed to accomodate for the pandemic, such as intense cleaning before flight boarding, less passengers per flight, and much more. We would like to learn what precautions are being taken to change for the state of the world and for people’s safety. Additionally, tracking how many people actually got the coronavirus from taking flights is also crucial information in one determining whether they want to board a flight or not. Data analysis on this information will provide useful insights for the citizens of the world, and aim to help them make an informed decision on whether they prefer to travel or not. "]]
