Describe the data sources: who is responsible for collecting the data? How is it collected? If there were a choice of options, explain how you chose. Provide some basic information about the dataset: types of variables, number of records, etc. Describe any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. (suggested: approximately 1 page) 2.2 Country Policy Orders Data Source: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-state-and-county-policy-orders 2.2.1 Description This is a federal government website managed by the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. This data is a manually curated dataset that provides a standardized view into state and county policy orders (executive orders, ordinances, etc.) from the following sources: BU COVID-19 State Policy Database - Raifman J, Nocka K, Jones D, Bor J, Lipson S, Jay J, and Chan P. (2020). “COVID-19 US state policy database.” wikidata - Stay At Home Policies Queried from WikiData. Manual curation by a dedicated group of Virtual Student Federal Service Interns - Summer 2020: T Adler, J Bastian, L Beckett, M Cohen, K Honey, C Kennedy, E Nudell. We chose this dataset over the BU google form linked in the sources because this dataset is much more consolidated. In addition, the website seems more reputable because it is from the government. 2.2.2 Basic Information about Dataset: The dataset has categories: State, county, zip code, policy level, date, start stop, comments, source, total phases. There are 3507 instances. The details are as below taken from their dictionary (https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-state-and-county-policy-orders-data-dictionary): state_id (string): The two digit state code for the policy change county (optional string): The county name where the policy change was implemented. Optional due to counties occasionally implementing their own policies. fips_code (string): A list of fips codes where the policy change is occurring. This is the authoritative column for where a county policy change occurs. policy_level (string): Whether the policy is a state of county-level policy. Either “state” or “county.” date (date, formatted YYYY-MM-dd): The date of the policy. Please note that there is also a start and stop column, to indicate whether this date is for the beginning or end of the policy. policy_type (string): The “type” of policy this in. Generically fitted in to many categories including Gym policies, Food and Drink policies, Stay at Home policies, and more. start_stop (string): Either “start” or “stop” Indicating whether this entry is for the beginning or end of a policy, respectively. comments (string): Details about the policies. In some cases, simply a link to a website with more information. source (string): Where this policy comes from. Either BU COVID-19 Policy Database, Wikidata, manual (no source), or sip_submission_form (with source website URL). total_phases (integer): As some states shifted to reopening policies, this column captures the number of phases of reopening that were expected. Issues about data: This dataset pulls from many different sources. Hence, there are some missing values because some instances only have information about states in general rather than counties. 2.3 Hospitalization Data Data Source: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-estimated-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state 2.3.1 Description This is a federal government website managed by the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. The following dataset provides state-aggregated data for hospital utilization. These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities. The file will be updated daily and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting. We chose this dataset because it is from a very official source and is consolidated rather than its sources. 2.3.2 Basic Information on this dataset: They are all numerical values. Some percentages and some numbers. There are 60 different columns and 54 instances. Details of all the columns are listed in this dictionary (https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state-data-dictionary) Some examples are listed below: state: The two digit state code critical_staffing_shortage_today_yes: Number of hospitals reporting a critical staffing shortage today in this state. hospital_onset_covid: Total current inpatients with onset of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 fourteen or more days after admission for a condition other than COVID-19 in this state. previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed: Number of patients who were admitted to an adult inpatient bed on the previous calendar day who had confirmed COVID-19 at the time of admission in this state staffed_adult_icu_bed_occupancy: Reported total number of staffed inpatient adult ICU beds that are occupied in this state total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_and_suspected_covid_coverage: Number of hospitals reporting total_staffed_adult_icu_beds: Reported total number of staffed inpatient adult ICU beds in this state inpatient_beds_utilization: Percentage of inpatient beds that are being utilized in this state. This number only accounts for hospitals in the state that report both “inpatient_beds_used” and “inpatient_beds” fields. inpatient_bed_covid_utilization_coverage: Number of hospitals reporting both “inpatient_beds_used_covid” and “inpatient_beds”. adult_icu_bed_covid_utilization: Percentage of total staffed adult ICU beds currently utilized by patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in this state. This number only accounts for hospitals in the state that report both “staffed_icu_adult_patients_confirmed_and_suspected_covid” and “total_staffed_adult_icu_beds” fields. reporting_cutoff_start: Look back date start - The latest reports from each hospital is summed for this report starting with this date. Issues with data: According to the data source no statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data. Otherwise, we do not see major issues. 2.4 Restaurant data : Data source https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry 2.4.1 Description The data indexes two things. First, the overall impact of Covid 19 on the industry by showing year-over-year seated diners at a sample of restaurants on the OpenTable network across all channels: online reservations, phone reservations, and walk-ins. For year-over-year comparisons by day, we compare to the same day of the week from the same week in the previous year. For example, we’d compare Tuesday of week 11 in 2020 to Tuesday of week 11 in 2019. Only states or metros with 50+ restaurants on the OpenTable network for 2019 or 2020 are included in the sample. To better reflect the state of the industry overall, this dataset is based on a sample of approximately 20,000 restaurants that provide OpenTable with information on all of their inventory. This sample of restaurants typically accounts for a majority of our seated online reservations. Second, a comparison of year-over-year seated covers to demonstrate where we are seeing recovery start to take shape. This table shows year-over-year seated covers across all channels at only the restaurants that have chosen to reopen in a given market. As an example, if there were 50 seated covers in restaurants that have recently reopened in a given locale on May 11, 2019 and on the same day in 2020 there was 1, then 2% will be displayed. For this chart, only markets with 500+ restaurants on OpenTable of which 10%+ are accepting online reservations are included. 2.5 Airlines Data Data source https://www.bts.gov/data-spotlight/airlines-july-operations 2.5.1 Description This airlines data is from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The BTS is part of the Department of Transportation and is the main source of data on many different transportation factors such as commercial aviation, transportation economics, and freight activity. The data provided on this website is collected from the Bureau’s National Transportation Library, which contains many different publications and information about the transportation community. We chose this dataset because it provides valuable information on how the airline community was affected by the oncoming of the now widespread pandemic, Covid-19. 2.5.2 Basic Information about Dataset: year(int) - year of flight month(string) - month of flight Total Domestic Flights Operated(int) - total number of flights operated that month/year airline(string) - airline brand Issues about dataset: Since there is limited information in this dataset, we will have to manipulate some variables using the information we have to analyze the data further and make stronger conclusions. Additional variables will include numerical variables such as the percent change in number of flights from each month in 2019 and 2020. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Country Policy Orders: 3.2 Hospitalization Data: 3.3 Airlines Covid Data: 3.4 Restaurant data :", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Describe the process of getting the data into a form in which you could work with it in R. If your code does not lend itself to being including in the .Rmd file, provide a link to the folder or file(s) that contain(s) that code. Write a draft of the Data Transformation chapter 3.1 Country Policy Orders: This dataset comes in a csv format, which can be read in using R commands. 3.2 Hospitalization Data: This dataset comes in a csv format, which can be read in using R commands. 3.3 Airlines Covid Data: This dataset comes in a xlsx format, therefore we installed the “readxl” package, and read in the data using the commands from that package. Since there are some extra spaces in the excel sheet, we remade the table into a form that had no blank spaces, and thus easily callable by column name, which is a dataframe in R. Combining all the columns together into a dataframe, we then renamed the columns such that it would be representative of the information in the column. Lastly, since all the data was in character format, we converted all the columns that had numeric data to a numeric form, such that it can be easily used to create graphs and other visual structures to aid us in our exploratory analysis. Our final product of the downloaded data was a dataframe in R, which had columns that were clearly represented by their names, no missing slots or data, and all the data was the right type of class to work with. 3.4 Restaurant data : This dataset comes in a csv format, which can be read in using R commands. This data contains information for other countries, we need to select US cities. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Country Policy Orders: 4.2 Hospitalization: 4.3 Airlines Covid Data: 4.4 Restaurant data:", " Chapter 4 Missing values Describe any patterns you discover in missing values. 4.1 Country Policy Orders: There are a few missing values county, zip_code, and total phases. This is because some states do not have details about counties. Hence there is no zip code and country details. In addition, most instances do not have total phases. 4.2 Hospitalization: There are some 0 values that may be missing values in our dataset. 4.3 Airlines Covid Data: There are no values missing in our dataset. The only “missing values” we had were those in the year column. The way the data was initially presented in the table, one year was written in the year column on the first row for the whole year, meaning for the next 12 rows, representing a month per row. In order to make our data more understandable and usable, such that we would not have to hard code any data, we added values to the year column, instead of leaving it blank, such that we would have a full dataset to work with. For example, instead of having only 2019 in the first row under the year column, we added 2019 to the rest of the rows until December in the year column, such that we would have a full dataset, making it easier to classify and facet data if necessary. 4.4 Restaurant data: There are many missing values in the dataset before May 2020. We also need to extract data for US.

Although, the 2019 data includes all months, while the 2020 data includes only the first 7 months, therefore, we will further our analysis using only the first 7 months of the 2019 data as well. Using only the first 7 months of the 2019 data to compare its results more accuractely with the first 7 months of the 2020 data, there is still a clear distinctment between the number of flights taken in 2019 vs. 2020. But, since we are using all of our 2020 data, we cannot make any analyses on the effect of the pandemic on travel as travel restrictions began in March. Therefore, we are going to plot the pattern of flights taken throughout last year and this year to analyze the impact. Using this graph, we can clearly see a big drop in flights from March to April of 2020. One can assume from this drop that the pandemic most likely played a role in the decrease of flights. Around May, the number of flights slowly start to increase, but not to the level that it was at the beginning of the year, as can be seen by the comparison to the flights taken in May of 2019. Even though flight frequency increased, it is still greatly decreased from the regular frequency of flights. Let us see how the pattern of the number of coronavirus cases in the United States affected the travel pattern. This graph shows when the coronavirus hit the United States hard, and affected many different factors, one being the airline industry and travel. Although there were cases in January, the number of cases quickly ramped up from March to April, which correlates with the decline in travel. From the graph, it can be seen that around May, although cases were still increasing, travel started to increase again, as people started to most likely relax on restrictions. This data shows by how much percent the number of flights in each airline decreased from the first couple months, pre-covid, to the rest of the year, after the oncoming of the pandemic in the United States. As shown by the graph, every single airline was affected by the pandemic as they all have a positive percent change, meaning that there was a decline in the number of flights for each airline. The airlines that were affected the most were JetBlue, Hawaiian, and United. These airlines had at least a 60% decline in flights when the pandemic started. This graph shows the time series data of the top four airline brands affected, taken from the previous graph. The trends stay consistent with the trends that we’ve been seeing in the previous graphs. Final Findings on Airline Data: The most revealing findings from this exploratory data analysis showed a couple of things. Firstly, there was a major decrease in flights from the year 2019 to the year 2020. Secondly, the number of flights mainly dropped in April of 2020, correlating with the time that the lockdown started and travel restrictions were placed everywhere. Looking at each airline, there was a decrease of the total number of flights taken for each airline, showing that almost every airline industry was affected by the pandemic. Some airlines had a decrease in flights by more than 60%, showing the intensity of the effect on the airline industry. More than half of their revenue was gone. Overall, in terms of the effect on travel during the coronavirus pandemic, there are clear patterns that show that travel was greatly affected. Airplanes were not a first choice method of transporation anymore, as people were not even travelling in the first place. This major decline in airline transportation and travel in and out of the United States, shows how greatly the pandemic played a role in the decline of the airline industry. 5.4 Covid Impact on Restaurants: "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
